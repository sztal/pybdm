	abstract = {We propose a measure based upon the fundamental theoretical concept in algorithmic information theory that provides a natural approach to the problem of evaluating n-dimensional complexity by using an n-dimensional deterministic Turing machine. The technique is interesting because it provides a natural algorithmic process for symmetry breaking generating complex n-dimensional structures from perfectly symmetric and fully deterministic computational rules producing a distribution of patterns as described by algorithmic probability. Algorithmic probability also elegantly connects the frequency of occurrence of a pattern with its algorithmic complexity, hence effectively providing estimations to the complexity of the generated patterns. Experiments to validate estimations of algorithmic complexity based on these concepts are presented, showing that the measure is stable in the face of some changes in computational formalism and that results are in agreement with the results obtained using lossless compression algorithms when both methods overlap in their range of applicability. We then use the output frequency of the set of 2-dimensional Turing machines to classify the algorithmic complexity of the space-time evolutions of Elementary Cellular Automata.},

However, with the newly developed coding theorem method the complexity of strings of length 2-11 can now be numerically estimated. We present the theoretical basis of algorithmic complexity for short strings (ACSS) and describe an R-package providing functions based on ACSS that will cover psychologists’ needs and improve upon previous methods in three ways: (1) ACSS is now available not only for binary strings, but for strings based on up to 9 different symbols, (2) ACSS no longer requires time-consuming computing, and (3) a new approach based on ACSS gives access to an estimation of the complexity of strings of any length. Finally, three illustrative examples show how these tools can be applied to psychology.},

The strategy behind BDM is to ﬁnd small computer programs that produce the components of a larger, decomposed object. The set of short computer programs can then be artfully arranged in sequence so as to produce the original object. We show that the method provides efﬁcient estimations of algorithmic complexity but that it performs like Shannon entropy when it loses accuracy. We estimate errors and study the behaviour of BDM for different boundary conditions, all of which are compared and assessed in detail. The measure may be adapted for use with more multi-dimensional objects than strings, objects such as arrays and tensors. To test the measure we demonstrate the power of CTM on low algorithmic-randomness objects that are assigned maximal entropy (e.g., π) but whose numerical approximations are closer to the theoretical low algorithmic-randomness expectation. We also test the measure on larger objects including dual, isomorphic and cospectral graphs for which we know that algorithmic randomness is low. We also release implementations of the methods in most major programming languages—Wolfram Language (Mathematica), Matlab, R, Perl, Python, Pascal, C++, and Haskell—and an online algorithmic complexity calculator.},

	abstract = {Consciousness is thought to scale with brain complexity, and it may be diminished in anesthesia. LempelZiv complexity (LZC) of ﬁeld potentials has been shown to be a promising measure of the level of consciousness in anesthetized human subjects, neurological patients, and across the sleep-wake states in rats. Whether this relationship holds for intrinsic networks obtained by functional brain imaging has not been tested. To ﬁll this gap of knowledge, we estimated LZC from large-scale dynamic analysis of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) in conscious sedated and unconscious anesthetized rats. Blood oxygen dependent (BOLD) signals were obtained from 30-min whole-brain resting-state scans while the anesthetic propofol was infused intravenously at constant infusion rates of 20 mg/kg/h (conscious sedated) and 40 mg/kg/h (unconscious). Dynamic brain networks were deﬁned at voxel level by sliding window analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the BOLD signal. From scans performed at low to high propofol dose, the LZC was signiﬁcantly reduced by 110\%. The results suggest that the difference in LZC between conscious sedated and anesthetized unconscious subjects is conserved in rats and this effect is detectable in large-scale brain network obtained from fMRI.},
